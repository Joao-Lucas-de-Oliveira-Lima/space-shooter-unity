### Introduction
*Killiam3 Rebellion* is a top-down space shooter where players take on the role of a space soldier aboard the spaceship **Killiam3**. Armed with a powerful arsenal, the player will face waves of alien invaders in various arenas. The ultimate goal is to protect their world and its inhabitants from annihilation.


### Story
In the year 2223, the player's world is under attack by strange alien creatures. Despite humanity's attempts to communicate, the invaders seek domination by exploiting natural resources and enslaving the population through genetic experiments.

As a member of the newly formed **Global Alliance** (name TBD), players join the resistance in a quest to stop the invasion. With the first generation of combat-ready spacecraft, their mission is to infiltrate the enemy fleet and destroy the mothership located in the [Sector TBD].
